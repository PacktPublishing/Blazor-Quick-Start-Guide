This book covers the following exciting features:
* Familiarize yourself with the core concepts of Blazor
* Develop applications with Blazor
* Blazor applications with Visual Studio code and Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game with Blazor
* Design and build a calculator app with Blazor
